        "- Added Auth page implementing google login using Trae AI. Also added proper middleware to ensure logged in users only had access to their own account using Trae AI.",
        "- Added New User page to set the username and initialize a user in the database.",
        "- Added user data to the home page.",
        "- Added locations to the server. The server now can wipe and generate territories and nodes. Setup the first tavern as the spawn point for new users.",
        "- Generated territories and nodes use randomly generated names generated using ChatGPT+ (o3-mini-high). System uses prefixes and names to create large quantities of possible names. Territories, camps, and taverns each have a unique pool of names. Also created monster and npc names, although not implemented yet.",

        "Using TraeAI has been a huge help. It basically replaces googling, reading, and typing when implementing apis or commonly used functions. Firebase was implemented without opening documentation. That's a huge time-save.",
        "Using ChatGPT+ has also been helpful. ChatGPT is a better platform for fleshing out the theme.",
